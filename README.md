### Switch from Stripe to another Payment Gateway

If you're using Stripe, you can switch to another payment gateway by changing the environment variable in the `.env` file and implement your own `PaymentService.php`.

### Switch from Tailwind to another CSS Framework

If you're using Tailwind, you can switch to another CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma. Feel free to remove the Tailwind CSS config and replace them with your own.
